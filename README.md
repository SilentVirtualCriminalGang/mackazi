# NetVendor

## Introduction
*What vendors are lurking on your network? This software figures this out!*

NetVendor is a Python tool designed specifically for network administrators and cybersecurity professionals to analyze and visualize the vendor distribution of all devices on their network. It processes MAC address tables and IP ARP data from Cisco, HP/Aruba, and other network routers and switches to provide detailed insights into your network's composition.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Working internet connection (for IEEE OUI database updates)
- Input file containing MAC addresses from network devices (routers and switches)
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - requests
  - plotly
  - rich
  - tqdm

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/StewAlexander-com/NetVendor.git
cd NetVendor
```

2. Install the package:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
Run the script with your network device output file:
```bash
netvendor input_file.txt
```

### Input File Format
The tool accepts output from common network device commands:

1. **Cisco IOS/IOS-XE MAC Address Table**
```
Vlan    Mac Address       Type        Ports
----    -----------      --------    -----
 10     0011.2233.4455   DYNAMIC     Gi1/0/1
```

2. **Cisco NX-OS MAC Address Table**
```
VLAN     MAC Address     Type        Port
----     -----------     --------    -----
 10      0011.2233.4455  dynamic     Eth1/1
```

3. **Cisco IOS/IOS-XE ARP Table**
```
Protocol  Address          Age (min)  Hardware Addr   Type   Interface
Internet  192.168.1.1            -   0011.2233.4455  ARPA   GigabitEthernet1/0/1
```

4. **HP/Aruba MAC Address Table**
```
MAC Address       Port    Type    VLAN
0011.2233.4455    1       dynamic 10
```

### Output Files
The tool generates several output files in the `output` directory:

1. **Device Information CSV**
   - Lists all discovered network devices
   - Includes MAC address, vendor, VLAN, and port information
   - Useful for inventory management and network documentation

2. **Port Report CSV** (for MAC address tables)
   - Shows port utilization on switches
   - Lists devices connected to each port
   - Includes VLAN and vendor information per port
   - Helps with network troubleshooting and capacity planning

3. **Vendor Distribution HTML**
   - Interactive dashboard with multiple visualizations
   - Vendor distribution pie chart
   - VLAN analysis charts
   - Device distribution across network segments
   - Helps network administrators understand their network composition

4. **Vendor Summary Text**
   - Plain text summary of vendor distribution
   - Quick reference for network documentation
   - Easy to share with team members

## Project Status
NetVendor is actively maintained and regularly updated with new features and improvements. Future plans include:
- Support for additional network device output formats
