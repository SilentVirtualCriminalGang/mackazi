# NetVendor

## Introduction
*What vendors are lurking on your network? This software figures this out!*

NetVendor is a Python tool for analyzing network device vendors from MAC address tables or IP ARP data. It helps network administrators identify and track devices on their network by vendor, providing organized output and visual analytics.

   - Organizes files in a clean directory structure

3. **Visualization**
   - Interactive dashboard with multiple views:
     - Vendor distribution pie chart with detailed hover information
     - VLAN device count analysis
     - VLAN distribution per vendor heatmap
   - Easy navigation between different visualizations
   - Downloadable charts and data

4. **Analysis**
   - Identifies hidden VLANs
   - Maps devices to IP addresses
   - Tracks network composition changes
   - Provides plain text summaries for easy sharing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Working internet connection (for IEEE OUI database updates)
- Input file containing MAC addresses
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - requests
  - plotly
  - rich
  - tqdm

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/StewAlexander-com/NetVendor.git
cd NetVendor

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script:
```bash
python NetVendor.py <input_file>
```

The script will:
1. Check for required dependencies
2. Process devices with progress visualization
3. Generate an interactive dashboard with multiple visualizations
4. Create a plain text summary and CSV report
5. Organize all output files in the `output` directory

### Input
The program accepts ARP or MAC address tables as input, such as:
- Cisco IOS `show ip arp`
- Cisco IOS `show mac address-table`
- Any text file containing MAC addresses in a column

Example input format:
```
Internet  10.0.0.1   1   0123.4567.89ab  ARPA   Vlan100
Internet  10.0.0.2   1   abcd.ef01.2345  ARPA   Vlan100
```

### Output
NetVendor generates five types of output:

1. **Console Output**
   - Real-time dependency checks
   - Progress bars for MAC address processing
   - Summary table showing vendor distribution

2. **Interactive HTML Dashboard** (`output/vendor_distribution.html`)
