# NetVendor

## Introduction
*What vendors are lurking on your network? This software figures this out!*

NetVendor is a Python tool for analyzing network device vendors from MAC address tables or IP ARP data. It helps network administrators identify and track devices on their network by vendor, providing organized output and visual analytics.

## Features
- Parses MAC address tables and ARP tables from various network devices
- Identifies device vendors using MAC address OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) lookups
- Generates detailed reports and visualizations
- Supports multiple input formats:
  - Cisco IOS/IOS-XE show mac address-table
  - Cisco NX-OS show mac address-table
  - Cisco IOS/IOS-XE show ip arp
  - HP/Aruba show mac-address
  - Generic MAC address lists
- Pre-seeded OUI database from Wireshark's manufacturers database
- Interactive HTML visualizations of vendor and VLAN distributions
- CSV exports for detailed device information

### Why Use NetVendor?
- **Security**: Understanding what exists in your network is essential for security

### How It Works
1. **Device Discovery**
   - Downloads the latest IEEE OUI database
   - Identifies devices from major vendors (Apple, Cisco, Dell, HP, Mitel)
   - Shows real-time progress for each operation

2. **Data Organization**
   - Creates vendor-specific device lists in text format

   - Organizes files in a clean directory structure

3. **Visualization**
   - Interactive dashboard with multiple views:
     - Vendor distribution pie chart with detailed hover information
     - VLAN device count analysis
     - VLAN distribution per vendor heatmap
   - Easy navigation between different visualizations
   - Downloadable charts and data

4. **Analysis**
   - Identifies hidden VLANs
   - Maps devices to IP addresses
   - Tracks network composition changes
   - Provides plain text summaries for easy sharing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Working internet connection (for IEEE OUI database updates)
- Input file containing MAC addresses
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - requests
  - plotly
  - rich
  - tqdm

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/StewAlexander-com/NetVendor.git
cd NetVendor
```

2. Install the package:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
Run the script:
```bash
netvendor input_file.txt
```

The script will:
1. Check for required dependencies
2. Process devices with progress visualization
3. Generate an interactive dashboard with multiple visualizations
4. Create a plain text summary and CSV report
5. Organize all output files in the `output` directory

### Updating the OUI Cache

The package includes a pre-seeded `oui_cache.json` file containing manufacturer information from Wireshark's database. This cache is automatically installed with the package and used by default. However, if you need to update the cache with the latest manufacturer information, you can run:

```bash
update-oui-cache
```

This will fetch the latest manufacturer database from Wireshark and update your local cache.

### Input File Formats
The tool supports several input file formats:

1. Cisco IOS/IOS-XE show mac address-table:
```
          Mac Address Table
-------------------------------------------
Vlan    Mac Address       Type        Ports
----    -----------       --------    -----
 100    0001.0001.0001    DYNAMIC     Gi1/0/1
```

2. Cisco NX-OS show mac address-table:
```
* - primary entry, G - Gateway MAC, (R) - Routed MAC, O - Overlay MAC
age - seconds since last seen,+ - primary entry using vPC Peer-Link, (T) - True, (E) - Egress
   VLAN     MAC Address     Type      age     Secure NTFY Ports/SWID.SSID.LID
---------+-----------------+--------+---------+------+----+------------------
* 100     0001.0001.0001   dynamic  0         F     F  Eth1/1
```

3. Cisco IOS/IOS-XE show ip arp:
```
Protocol  Address          Age (min)  Hardware Addr   Type   Interface
Internet  192.168.1.1            -   0001.0001.0001  ARPA   GigabitEthernet1/0/1
```

4. HP/Aruba show mac-address:
```
MAC Address         VLAN    Type    Port
----------------    ----    ----    ----
0001-0001-0001      100     DYNAMIC 1
```

5. Generic MAC address list:
```
0001.0001.0001
0002.0002.0002
```

### Output
NetVendor generates five types of output:

1. **Console Output**
   - Real-time dependency checks
   - Progress bars for MAC address processing
   - Summary table showing vendor distribution

2. **Interactive HTML Dashboard** (`output/vendor_distribution.html`)
